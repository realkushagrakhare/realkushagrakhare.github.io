user_title: AR | VR | Game | Graphics Programmer
user_description: Welcome to my little slice of the interwebs. I'm Kushagra and as you've probably guessed from the title of this website I'm a huge game programming, augmented & virtual reality and graphics enthusiast. In my spare time, I am messing around with game engines, figuring out new and interesting ways of doing things, working on lighting reconstruction for AR or even playing games like FIFA and Mario. I enjoy working with people that share similar interests so feel free to get in touch with me.

Below you'll find some of my projects I've been working on lately. You can find out the details and repository and of several of my projects on Github.
